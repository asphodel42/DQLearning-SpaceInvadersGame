# DQLearning-SpaceInvadersGame
<h1>Deep Q-Learning alghoritm for Space Invaders game</h1>

<h2>Installation</h2>

A project is created to implement and study a model-free machine learning method called reinforcement learning.

<h2>Objective</h2> 
The goal is to find:
[] optimal parameters
[] time 
[] learning curves 
for the bot, which will allow us to investigate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in an artificial environment - a videogame. 
The method consists of a set of environment states, a set of actions, a reward function, and a state transition function.

<h2>Explanation</h2>
The computer game space invaders will be used for the study, the software agent will have to find the optimal winning strategy based on its own experience in the artificial environment.
The agent will receive a reward for correct actions. For losses, it will receive nothing.

During the development of the bot, a greedy Q-learning strategy will be used, which means that the action with the best Q score will be selected. The algorithm will be guided by the Bellman equation.

<h2>Expected Results</h2>
As a result, the coefficients gamma (devaluation coefficient) and alpha (learning rate) will be obtained.
Learning curves, scatter matrix, and correlation matrix will be built. 
The data will be saved in the database for further analysis.
